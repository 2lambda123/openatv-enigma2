== TS FILES ==

TS files are plain recordings, including PMT and PAT.

They don't have a private header. 

== .meta FILES ==

.meta files have currently 4 lines:

<service reference>
<name>
<description>
<recording time>


== .ap FILES ==

Stored offsets and PTS values. They are collected while recording. Only 
GOP starts are stored.

File format is network-ordered (i.e. big endian), each entry contains
two 64 bit values (PTS, offset).

PTS values are not corrected (i.e. they aren't zero-based), offsets are
relative to the beginning of the file (or first file, when we implement
splitting)

== .cut FILES ==

Also network ordered, they contain a 64bit value (PTS) and 32bit value
(type) for each cut. (If you want file offsets, use the .ap file to look up
the PTS values.)

Type is:

0 - 'in' point
1 - 'out' point
2 - mark

If the first 'out'-point is not preceeded by an 'in'-point, there is an 
implicit 'in' point at zero.

If the there is no final 'out' point, the end-of-file is an implicit
'out'-point.
