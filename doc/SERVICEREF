Structure and interpretation of servicerefs
===========================================

REFTYPE:FLAGS:STYPE:SID:TSID:ONID:NS:PARENT_SID:PARENT_TSID:UNUSED:PATH:NAME

"Printf" format of the string format of a serviceref:
    %d:%d:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%d:%s%s

=== REFTYPE ===

idInvalid      =   -1
idStructure    =    0         service_id == 0 is root
idDVB          =    1
idFile         =    2
idUser         = 4096/0x1000
idServiceMP3   = 4097/0x1001
HDMI IN        = 8192/0x2000

Defined in class eServiceReference in enigma2/lib/service/iservice.h,
except for HDMI IN valus.

=== FLAGS ===

isDirectory      =   1  SHOULD enter  (implies mustDescent)
mustDescent      =   2  cannot be played directly
canDescent       =   4  supports enterDirectory/leaveDirectory
flagDirectory    =   7  (isDirectory|mustDescent|canDescent)
shouldSort       =   8  should be ASCII-sorted according to service_name.
                        great for directories.
hasSortKey       =  16  has a sort key in data[3]. not having a sort key
                        implies 0.
sort1            =  32  sort key is 1 instead of 0
isMarker         =  64  Marker
isGroup          = 128  is a group of services
isNumberedMarker = 256  use together with isMarker,
                        to force the marker to be numbered
isInvisible      = 512  use together with isMarker and isNumberedMarker,
                        to force an empty number

Defined in class eServiceReference in enigma2/lib/service/iservice.h.

=== STYPE ===

stype  1 = digital television service
stype  4 = nvod reference service (NYI)
stype  2 = digital radio sound service
stype 10 = advanced codec digital radio sound service
stype 13 = ??? used for filler entries in
           /etc/enigma2/userbouquet.terrestrial_lcn.tv
stype 17 = MPEG-2 HD digital television service
stype 22 = advanced codec SD digital television
stype 24 = advanced codec SD NVOD reference service (NYI)
stype 25 = advanced codec HD digital television
stype 27 = advanced codec HD NVOD reference service (NYI)

Documented in enigma2/RecordTimer.py, except for stype 13.

=== DVB fields ===

SID         - Stream ID

TSID        - Transport stream ID

ONID        - Originating network ID

NS          - DVB namespace

PARENT_SID  - Service parent Stream ID

PARENT_TSID - Service parent Transport stream ID

=== "UNUSED" field ===

Is in fact used for servicerefs with idServiceMP3

0    no buffering
1    buffering enabled
3    progressive download and buffering enabled


Documented in enigma2/lib/service/servicemp3.cpp.

=== PATH ===

Path specifying the source of the service data. E.g. filesystem
path name for files being played, URL for streaming services,
directory pathname for isDirectory/mustDescent/canDescent services
in a file system. Empty for broadcast services and HDMI IN.

=== NAME ===

REFTYPE-dependent text data associated with the service ref. Used,
for example, to store additional filename extension mappings in
idFile servicerefs where any flagDirectory bits are set, to store
the playlist name in idServiceMP3 servicerefs, and to store service
name information in idDVB servicerefs.
