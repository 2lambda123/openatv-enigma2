Right now, the exact LICENSE to be used for enigma2 is undecided.

enigma2 will be licensed with a proprietary, not-yet decided license.

This proprietary license will not allow you to compile, modify or do
anything with this sources. You are allowed, however, to distribute
an unmodified version of the sources, including all license statements.

The proprietary license will essentially allow you one thing:

You are free to take *THIS* version of enigma2, and derive a version 
which will be licensed under the GPLv2. If you're doing this,
be sure to insert proper licencening statements to ensure that it
doesn't get mixed up with the proprietary version.

The derived version can be, of course, modified, distributed etc. in
modified forms, however, you have to publish all changes you made in
source form if you are distributing a binary version. Exact details
can be read in the GPLv2.

If you wish do send us patches to be included in the "official 
release", which will be based on the proprietary license, you have to
agree that your code will be licensed under the proprietary license.

Note that "official release" just means the version which is shipped
with the Dreambox hardware.

You are, of course, free to make patches to a GPL-only version. These
changes won't show up in the "official release" then, though.

The same goes for plugins. You can decide wheter you want your plugins
to be compatible to the "official release" (so you must explicitely
allow "linking" code licensed under the proprietary license to your
code), or you can decide that your code should be only linked to
the GPL'ed ("free") version of enigma2.
